PIXUP BY ELIE CHIKHANI, JOSEE AL ASMAR AND CLARA REZKALLAH

This is the local version of our website (treated as a betta version). 

Import the mysql file into phpmyadmin locally (after creating a database called pixup) to get the database containing 2 test accounts. 


All modules outside any folder represent all the pages seen by the user. 

The components files, contain all elements and componenets being reused in many pages 
The dbModule file contains all the algorthims that requires a connection with the database. 


REMARKS : 
Even if the website is running locally, having a good internet is crucial to run the categorizing API and the javascript libraries ! 
The categorizing API imagga might fail sometimes categorzing an image (since we are using the free version) , in this case the image will be uploaded anyway without categories.
